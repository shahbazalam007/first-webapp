      <h1>About This Site

Adarsh-Paithology is an educational resource with high quality pathology images of benign and malignant neoplasms and related entities. It was launched in 2003 by Dr. Dharam Ramnani , with an initial focus on urologic pathology. It was subsequently expanded to include other organ systems.

The site offers a visual survey of surgical pathology with emphasis on high-quality gross specimen photographs and photomicrographs. Each image is accompanied by a discussion of pertinent clinical and pathologic features. Imaging studies and management are included wherever applicable.

With rapid advances in the fields of cancer genomics and precision medicine, the focus of WebPathology has recently broadened to include illustrations showing molecular pathways in various cancers, including sites of targeted intervention.

As of February 2022, WebPathology has more than 11,500 images. It has become a valuable pathology resource for medical professionals around the world. It is being used by more than 60K monthly visitors from more than 185 countries and receives more than 800K monthly pageviews.
